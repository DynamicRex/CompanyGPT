# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
The CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is a crucial component of our development workflow. It automates the process of testing and deploying code changes, ensuring that our application is always in a deployable state. This document outlines the setup and configuration of the CI/CD pipeline for the CompanyGPT project.

## Pipeline Setup

### Initial Setup
The CI/CD pipeline was initially configured using GitHub Actions. The pipeline was designed to:
- Run automated tests.
- Lint the codebase.
- Install dependencies.
- Deploy the application upon successful validation.

The primary file controlling the pipeline is the `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`.

### Node.js Version
The pipeline uses Node.js v20. This version was chosen to avoid issues related to deprecations and syntax compatibility seen in earlier versions.

```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '20'
Python Version
The backend of CompanyGPT uses Python 3.10. This was configured in the pipeline for running backend tests and managing dependencies.

yaml
Copy code
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v2
  with:
    python-version: '3.10'
Environments
Development Branch
We have established a dedicated development branch for active development. This branch is where most CI/CD tests and validations occur before merging into the main branch.

Main Branch
The main branch is considered stable. Only thoroughly tested and validated changes from the development branch are merged into the main.

Pipeline Workflow
Linting
The pipeline includes a linting stage to ensure code quality and adherence to style guidelines.

yaml
Copy code
- name: Run ESLint
  run: |
    cd frontend
    npm run lint
Testing
Backend Tests: The pipeline runs backend tests using Pytest.

yaml
Copy code
- name: Run backend tests
  run: |
    pytest backend/tests
Frontend Tests: Jest is used for testing frontend components.

yaml
Copy code
- name: Run frontend tests
  run: |
    cd frontend
    npm test
Installing Dependencies
Both frontend and backend dependencies are installed during the CI/CD process to ensure the latest and correct packages are used.

yaml
Copy code
- name: Install backend dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

- name: Install frontend dependencies
  run: |
    cd frontend
    npm install
Installed Dependencies
Backend
The backend dependencies include:

FastAPI
Uvicorn
Pytest
Requests/HTTPX
Python-dotenv
These dependencies are managed via a requirements.txt file generated by pip freeze.

Frontend
The frontend dependencies include:

React
React-DOM
Axios
Redux
Jest (for testing)
ESLint (for linting)
These are managed via package.json.

Testing
Backend Testing
Pytest is used to run automated tests on the backend. All tests are located in the backend/tests directory.

Frontend Testing
Jest is used to test the frontend components. The test files are located in the frontend/src directory.

Linting
ESLint is configured to enforce coding standards in the frontend JavaScript files.

Branching Strategy
Development Branch
Active development and feature testing occur on this branch. The CI/CD pipeline is set to run on every push to the development branch.

Main Branch
Only stable and tested changes are merged here. Merges into the main branch are done via pull requests from the development branch.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
ESLint Errors: If the linting stage fails, ensure that ESLint and Node.js versions are compatible.
Pytest Errors: Verify that all required Python packages are installed and correctly listed in requirements.txt.
Debugging Tips
Review the logs from the GitHub Actions interface for detailed error messages.
Ensure that all environment variables required for the tests are correctly set.
Future Improvements
Integration Testing: Consider adding integration tests that cover end-to-end workflows.
Performance Testing: Implement load and stress testing to ensure the application can handle high traffic.
Deployment Automation: Integrate automatic deployment to staging and production environments after successful builds.
